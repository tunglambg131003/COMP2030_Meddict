## üë®‚Äçüîß Installation 

### Pre-requisite

Before installing the service, you need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Please visit their instalation guides before continuing. 

### Setup 
1. Cloning the project with:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tunglambg131003/COMP2030_Meddict
```
2. Create a `.env` file, which will configure the application's environment variables for storing secret passwords, keys, etc. The sample of the `.env` can be found at [`.env_sample`](./env_sample) file. We recommend using some password generator to create the credentials. 
3. Create a `mongo-init.js` file from [`sample_mongo-init.js`](./sample_mongo-init.js). Please change the Mongo username & password according to the key `MONGODB_USERNAME` & `MONGODB_PASSWORD` at the `.env` file that you created in step 1. 
4. Run the following command:

```Bash
$ docker compose up -d build
```

You are done! Access the service at `localhost` via your web browser if you are installing in local machine, or the server IP address/domain name if you are deploying it on a cloud instance.
