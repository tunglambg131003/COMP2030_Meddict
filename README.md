Before installing the service, you need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Please visit their instalation guides before continuing. 

### Setup 

1. Create a `.env` file, which will configure the application's environment variables for storing secret passwords, keys, etc. The sample of the `.env` can be found at [`.env_sample`](./env_sample) file. We recommend using some specific password generator to create the credentials.
